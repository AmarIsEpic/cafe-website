# Cafe Website

A simple, modern café website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project uses a clean structure and responsive design, making it suitable for learning, practice, or a small business presentation.

The project consists of three main parts: `index.html` for the website structure, `style.css` for styling and layout, and an `images` folder that contains all visual assets used on the site.

The website features a responsive layout, modern café-style design, image-based sections, and easy-to-read, well-organized code that is simple to customize.

To run the project locally, simply download or clone the repository and open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No installation, dependencies, or build steps are required.

To deploy the website using GitHub Pages, push the project to a GitHub repository, go to **Settings → Pages**, select the `main` branch with the `/root` folder, and save. The website will then be available at `https://AmarIsEpic.github.io/cafe-website/`.

All images should be placed inside the `images` folder, and image paths in `index.html` should reference that folder correctly.

This project is free to use for educational and personal purposes.
